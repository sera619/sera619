- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick aka S3R43o3, x E-Sportler and a computer fan since the beginning of the 90`s. My damn first Game was the C64 version from prince of persia on 2 floppy disc.
  For sure this is just the beginning of a long journey to take the skills like a Full-Stack.
- 👀 I’m interested in all kind of Gaming, Techs and some normal other stuff like non-geeks have =D.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React-Native, Python and CeH
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React-Native or JS projects. Or CTF´s in teams (red)
